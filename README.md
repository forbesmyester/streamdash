# streamdash

Some base classes and implementation classes for doing functional-like development using streams. These include equivalents of Map, Filter and Reduce (Scan and Final) as well as some extra goodies for the adventurous.

For further information see the [source](./src/stream.ts), which is in TypeScript and is quite well documented.
